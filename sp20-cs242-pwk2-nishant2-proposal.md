# A Graphically Based Software for Easy Data Visualisations and Modelling
Peter Krawiec (pwk2) | Moderator: Nishant Rodrigues (nishant2)

This is my final project proposal for CS242
I plan to make a visually based software using python from which the user can easily load in their data (xlsx/csv) and be able to quickly and easily visualize it and model.

## Abstract
### Project Purpose
To provide a very quick way to get some data exploration done without having to work around software made for more functionality, giving the user the options of changing different attributes of the visualization using a click based approach.

### Project Motivation
At work I do a lot of statistical analysis using python and often I find myself writing repeat code for pretty trivial stuff, especially when doing data exploration.

## Technical Specification
- Programming Languages: Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, tkinter...)
- Stylistic Conventions: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/
- IDE: Visual Studio Code
- Tools/Interfaces: Computers
- Target Audience: Broad-range audience

## Functional Specification
### Features
- GUI with all click based controls
- Various data visualizations
- Various data modelling

### Scope of the project
- Limitations include formatting of data being input
- Assumptions include pythons GUI modules being relatively easy to work with

## Brief Timeline
- Week 1: Complete basic GUI, Load in data
- Week 2: Data visualizations, different options
- Week 3: Statistical Models implemented and visualized, different options
- Week 4: More complex Statistical models and visualized, (i.e. multiple linear regression visualization)
